# csci325_finalproject_website
This is the repository for csci 325 final project 
We will be creating a website with the back or server side with java. For the backend we can use a framework like tomcat perhaps. 
For the front end its fair game in terms of html, css and javascript. We can use any javascript library. IF you have any questions riase an issue here on github an I will try to answer it. 
Currently it is owned by Craig A.

We have to download a web server on your local machine some are tomcat(the easiest as the professor said), jboss and web logic (an old framework created by oracle)
