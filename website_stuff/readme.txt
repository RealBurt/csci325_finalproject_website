These are some model classes we can use as elements in two databases, one for questions and another for students and scores.
In addition, I included another controller class (Scores.java) that SHOULD give a pretty basic, default admin page, with a list of names and 
	scores as well.

Unfortunately, I was unable to fully test it because I ran into some unexpected housework as well as dependency problems and 
	as I'm writing this readme, I can barely keep my eyes open.
I'll take another look at it later, before we meet again to try and test to make sure it works.

These files will paste right into the play datastructure for Java projects.
