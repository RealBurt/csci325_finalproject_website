This is a set of static arrays and methods that should allow us to easily access variables without having to worry about 
  about passing them to new pages. It does this by generating a unique Username on the back end, setting that in the mName array
  and using that index for all other information related to that user it is scalable, you can add to it, but you must use get
  and set functions to work with the Arrays.
